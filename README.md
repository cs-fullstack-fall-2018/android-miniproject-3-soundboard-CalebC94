# Mini-Project - Android Sound Board

Objective: Demonstrate a working knowledge of Android application composition/variables/event handlers/playing audio clips

### Using the starter code included in this repository, complete the mini-project to create a simple Sound Board application

* Render a sound board that allows 5 or more different sounds to be displayed

* You can use whatever widgets you wish to allow the User to select the different sounds

* Some starter sounds have been included, and more can be found online including here: https://freesound.org/ (requires a free signup)

### Tips

* You DON'T want to use the old SoundPool class and should be using the newer SoundPool.Builder() approach

* Any additional sounds you copy to your res/raw directory can/should be renamed to shorter and easier to reference names (e.g. sound6.wav, sound7.wav, etc.)

### Extra Challenges

* Allow the user to select multiple sounds from the Sound Board and then play all selected in sequence when User presses a Play button
